<summary>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</summary>

- **Will I get banned for using this?**  
Highly unlikely.
  
- **Do I need to redownload config every game patch?**  
Game patch does not reset Engine.ini to default.  
If you run into issues, just grab the latest version of the config.

- **Can I change in-game settings?**  
Yes, it won't override any of the changes done through Engine.ini.

- **Engine.ini resets back to default upon game launch.**  
This shouldn't happen but if it does set the file to read-only.
  
- **How do I reset the ini files back to default?**  
Just delete the ini files, launching the game will create a new empty one.
